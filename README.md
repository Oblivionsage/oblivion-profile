## Oblivion Sage

Security researcher focused on real-world exploit paths, deep logic flaws, and critical vulnerabilities across modern stacks.

---

## Areas of Focus
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Insecure Deserialization
- Logic bugs in web frameworks
- CVE-level 0-day hunting
- Reverse engineering (Android, binaries, native libs)

- ##  Tooling & Arsenal
- Fuzzing (Atheris, LibFuzzer, honggfuzz)
- Binary Analysis (Ghidra, Cutter, IDA Free)
- Dynamic Debugging (gdb, lldb, rr)
- Android RE (JADX, Apktool, Frida, Objection)
- Web: Burp Suite, ffuf, XSS/RCE payload crafting
- High OPSEC pentesting workflows

---

##  Vision
Building vulnerability chains, not scanning for low-hanging fruit.  
If it doesn’t end in RCE or CVE, it’s not finished.
